            Biryani (pronounced [bɪr.jaːniː]) is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of India.
             It can be compared to mixing a curry, later combining it with semi-cooked rice separately.
             This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora.
             It is also prepared in other regions such as Iraqi Kurdistan.
             It is made with Indian spices, rice, meat (chicken, beef, goat, pork, lamb, prawn, or fish), or eggs.
             The word 'biryani' is derived from a Persian word, birian, which means fried before cooking. 
            It is one of the most popular dishes, which has acquired a niche for itself in South Asian cuisine.

		<p>
            Shawarma (/ʃəˈwɑːrmə/; Arabic: شاورما‎) is a dish in Middle Eastern cuisine consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in a cone-like shape, and roasted on a slowly-turning vertical rotisserie or spit.
             Originally made of lamb or mutton, today's shawarma may also be chicken, turkey, beef, or veal.
             Thin slices are shaved off the cooked surface as it continuously rotates.
             Shawarma is one of the world's most popular street foods, especially in Egypt and the countries of the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and beyond.

		<p>
            Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines.
             As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations.
             Fried rice first developed during the Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to Chinese fried rice.
